Tracks shipment of software versions for audit purposes.

The app has various "audit endpoints" to receive events,
such as deploys, builds, ticket creations, etc.

We use an append-only store, nothing in the DB is ever modified or deleted.
Event sourcing is used to replay each event allowing us to reconstruct the state
of the system at any point in time.

## Getting Started

Install the gems and set up the database.

```
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:setup
```

Set up Git hooks, for running tests and linters before pushing to master.

```
rake git:setup_hooks
```

### Enabling access to repositories via SSH

Ensure that `libssh2` is installed and the `rugged` gem is reinstalled. On OSX:

```
brew install libssh2
gem pristine rugged
```

When booting server, set Environment variables `SSH_USER`, `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` and `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`:

```
SSH_USER=git \
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY='ssh-rsa AAAXYZ' \
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY='-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----' \
rails s -p 1201
```

Note that port 1201 is only needed in development; it's the expected port by auth0 (the service we use for authentication).

You can also use Foreman to start the server and use settings from Heroku:

```
bin/boot_with_heroku_settings
```

### Enabling periodic snapshots

In order to stay performant, Shipment Tracker needs to regularly record snapshots. This can be setup using the
[`whenever` gem](https://github.com/javan/whenever) or, if you're on Heroku, using the
[Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler).

Just make sure the following command runs every few minutes:

```
rake jobs:update_events
```

*Warning:* If your application is deployed on multiple servers, make sure the recurring task runs only on one server.

### Enabling periodic git fetching

It's important to keep the Shipment Tracker git cache reasonably up-to-date to avoid timeouts. Please make
sure the following command runs every few minutes (see previous paragraph on how to do it):

```
rake jobs:update_git
```

*Warning:* If your application is deployed on multiple servers, make sure the recurring task runs on every server.
