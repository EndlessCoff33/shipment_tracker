Feature: Developer prepares a feature review so that it can be attached to a
  ticket for a PO to use in acceptance.

Background:
  Given I am logged in as "marcus@shipment-tracker.url"
  Given an application called "frontend"
  And an application called "backend"
  And an application called "mobile"
  And an application called "irrelevant"

Scenario: Preparing link for ticket
  When I prepare a feature review for:
    | field name | content             |
    | frontend   | abc123456789        |
    | backend    | def123456789        |
    | uat_url    | http://www.some.url |
  Then I should see the feature review page with the applications:
    | app_name | version |
    | frontend | abc1234 |
    | backend  | def1234 |
  And I can see the UAT environment "http://www.some.url"

Scenario: Viewing a feature review
  Given a ticket "JIRA-123" with summary "Urgent ticket" is started
  And a commit "#abc" by "Alice" is created for app "frontend"
  And a commit "#old" by "Bob" is created for app "backend"
  And a commit "#def" by "Bob" is created for app "backend"
  And a commit "#ghi" by "Carol" is created for app "mobile"
  And a commit "#xyz" by "Wendy" is created for app "irrelevant"
  And CircleCi "passes" for commit "#abc"
  And CircleCi "fails" for commit "#def"
  # Flaky tests, build retriggered.
  And CircleCi "passes" for commit "#def"
  And commit "#abc" is deployed by "Alice" on server "http://uat.fundingcircle.com"
